This project was intended to develop a starting point for a portfolio website that can be used to show a potential employer the scope of my work. Currently, I don't have much work to showcase, so I used placeholders. Until I have more projects to showcase, this functions as a template that I can use to build off of in the future.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://lexieholder.github.io/challenge-two-portfolio-reboot/
